My daily Snowflake learning journey, hands-on exercises, and portfolio projects — Aug 2025

Date 14th August:
1. Introduction to Snowflake

Snowflake is a cloud-native data platform that combines the power of a data warehouse, data lake, and data sharing platform — all in one service.

It’s not just “SQL in the cloud” — it’s designed from the ground up for:

Scalability → Handles terabytes to petabytes easily.

Separation of Compute & Storage → Pay separately for data storage and processing.

Multi-Cloud Support → Runs on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

Zero Maintenance → No patching, indexing, or tuning required.

Think of it as:

“The iPhone of data platforms — everything integrated, easy to use, but powerful under the hood.”

2. Why Companies Love Snowflake

No hardware to manage.

Pay only for what you use (credits model).

Near-infinite scalability — spin up more compute instantly.

Secure and governed data sharing between teams/companies.

High performance for analytics and BI.

3. Snowflake Architecture Overview

Snowflake has a unique 3-layer architecture:

a) Cloud Services Layer

The “brain” of Snowflake.

Manages authentication, access control, query optimization, metadata, and transactions.

Examples: Query parsing, security policies, role-based access.

b) Compute Layer (Virtual Warehouses)

Independent clusters of compute resources for running queries.

Each virtual warehouse can scale up/down or run in parallel.

Multiple teams can work without affecting each other.

c) Storage Layer

Stores data in compressed, columnar format.

Fully managed by Snowflake — you never worry about file systems.

Automatically organized into micro-partitions for speed.

4. Key Components

Here’s the must-know list for interviews and daily work:

Component	Description
Database	Logical container for schemas and tables.
Schema	Organizes tables, views, and other objects.
Tables	Store structured data (permanent, transient, temporary).
Views	Saved SQL queries (regular, secure, materialized).
Stages	Temporary storage for loading/unloading data (internal or external).
File Formats	Defines how to interpret incoming files (CSV, JSON, Parquet).
Virtual Warehouses	Compute clusters for running queries & loading data.
Roles & Grants	Security model for controlling access.
Tasks	Automates SQL execution at scheduled times.
Pipes (Snowpipe)	Continuous data loading without manual triggers.
Time Travel	Access data “as of” a point in time (up to 90 days).
Fail-safe	7-day recovery period after time travel expires.
5. High-Level Data Flow

Data Ingestion → Load files into stage → COPY INTO table.

Data Storage → Columnar, micro-partitioned, compressed.

Data Processing → Run queries on separate warehouses.

Data Sharing → Share without copying (secure data sharing).

Data Governance → Apply masking, roles, policies.

Conclusion:

Snowflake is a fully managed, cloud-native data platform with a unique architecture that separates compute from storage, enabling scalable, concurrent, and cost-effective analytics.
